## What are these?
A collection of *small* projects which predominantly focus on the development of my basic HTML/CSS skills during my inital months of self-teaching coding. Also, included first attempt at javascript which eludes to my new and exciting nursing triage tool project ([*click here to check the progress...*](https://miahbates.github.io/nursing-triage-tool/)). Although small, I feel these projects are worth promoting as they are part of my milestones in my coding journey.:sparkles:
